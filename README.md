# British Council - Learn English Kids

All resources list in this page are used for english learning purpose (just for my kids and me ^_^). All of them are free and you can watch these videos on British Council official website or youtube. I recommented you to download the app named "playtime" on app store if you are using an iPhone, It's very nice for kids learning. 

These fantastic learning materials also including worksheet, so you can do practise with your kids after watching each little story and you will find the answers at the end of **transcript & worksheet** section.
